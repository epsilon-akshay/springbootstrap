## tips

1. all annotation steriottypes has to be in the same dir as the main class
2. while using jpa you can have eager or lazy relationship meaning if the deopendency is heavy to load we can use lazy relationship
3. there is an issue with annotation based depdency injection which basically uses reflection and this is supposedly slow but this is only during application startup
